'first_results.pdf' contains the histograms of the Bayes Factors for each of the 3*2 algorithms for 16 randomly sampled conditions. Each condition was replicated 50 times and thus the histograms consist of 50 Bayes Factors. The evaluated algorithms are the product Bayes Factor, the geometric product Bayes Factor and the together Bayes Factor, where for each the complementary and unconstrained hypotheses are evaluated. They are colour coded with each algorithm being a different colour and the complementary and unconstrained having different shades of the same colour. The unconstrained is always the lighter shade.

To which algorithm the histograms belong can be seen on top of each pdf page. The titles of the histograms are the conditions specifications. The x lab contains the median, standard deviation and the proportion of BF's > 3.
