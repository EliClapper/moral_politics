There are 3 .R files in this directory
 1.) 'Simulatie_EliV2.R' contains the simulation. Its output is a data table with the results appended to the conditions the results belong to.
 2.) 'functions.R' contains the functions used in the simulation. the 'sim_data()' function simulates the data and the 'BFs()' function does the data manipulation.
 3.) 'preliminary_analysis.R()' contains the first analysis of the mini simulation that was ran. The output is 'first_results.pdf', a pdf file containing the Bayes Factor distributions of the algorithms for different conditions.

There are 3 .txt files in this directory
 1.) the README.txt file
 2.) 'explaining_first_results.txt', this file explains what can be seen in 'first_results.pdf'
 3.) 'Vragen_bij_script.txt', this file contains the aspects of the simulation I am unsure of and where feedback is most appreciated.

Further (less important) files:
 1.) 'summarydata.RData' contains the simulation conditions
 2.) 'sim_results_2022-03-14.csv' are the results of the test simulation in .csv extension.
 3.) 'sim_results_2022-03-14.RData' are the results of the test simulation in .RData extension.

There is one directory
 1.) 'Results' this is where the txt files created by the clusters during the simulation were stored. These files for the test simulation have already been omitted.
